# **Spatial Statistics**

This repository contains functions and tools for spatial data analysis and visualization with Python.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have Python 3.12 installed, along with pip, and ensure you're using a Linux terminal (such as Git Bash) to execute the following commands.

1. Initialize a Git repository in your project folder:
```bash
git init 
```

2. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/elianespitia/Spatial_Statistics.git
```

3. Create a virtual environment for the project:
```bash
python -m venv env
```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source env/scripts/activate
```

5. Install project dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6. Configure your email and name:
```bash
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

**Important Note**
It's a good practice to include the virtual environment folder in the .gitignore file. This will prevent it from being pushed to the remote repository and help keep the repository clean and organized.
